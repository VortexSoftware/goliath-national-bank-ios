## Solved 

### Requirements
- Do not block the UI while downloading the data from the network. Do not download the data from the network before showing the UI. ✓
- You must use Kotlin for Android or Swift for iOS and any third party libraries, as you would do with any project.
The use of design patterns, well structured code and project architecture will be valued (do it as you would with a project with a larger scope). ✓
- Remember that some conversion rates are missing, and they should be derived using the information provided.✓

### Extra points
- We are dealing with money. Try not to use floating point numbers. ✓
- After each conversion, the result should be rounded to two decimal places, using Bankers’ Rounding (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Round_half_to_even) ✓
- The right way to specify the request format in HTTP is not using a file extension, but using an “Accept” header. Instead of using the extension try to use the “Accept” header with the right MIME type. ✓
- Unit Testing. ✓
